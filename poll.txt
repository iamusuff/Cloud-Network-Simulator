I need you to help me build my Computer Networks course project. The project title is: Cloud Network Simulation and Visualization I want this project developed using Python, and I strongly prefer the following stack: Python 3 Tkinter  NetworkX (for graph/topology) Matplotlib (for graphs) Optional: Threads for smoother animation 🎯 PROJECT REQUIREMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT) The simulator must support the following four major modules: 1. Packet Flow and Routing Visualization A canvas where nodes and links are drawn User can create nodes + connect them (drag-and-drop if possible) Run Dijkstra’s algorithm to find routing path Visually animate a packet traveling hop-by-hop on the selected path 2. Latency and Throughput Measurement Every link should have: latency (ms) bandwidth (Mbps) The simulator must calculate: total path latency (sum of individual link latencies) throughput using bottleneck rule (minimum bandwidth along the path) These values should be displayed clearly in the UI. 3. Congestion Control Simulation Each link should also have: queue size (buffer capacity) a simple congestion model: if incoming packets > queue → packets dropped Optionally simulate: a basic TCP-like congestion window packet drop graph queue filling visualization 4. Network Topology Design and Visualization User interface to add nodes and links Visual representation using Tkinter canvas or PyQt canvas Real-time updating graph as nodes move or links are edited 📦 WHAT I WANT YOU TO PRODUCE FIRST Do NOT give code yet. First, produce a complete engineering-level plan containing: Full system architecture Folder structure Class structure + methods description Data structures for nodes, links, packets Flow diagrams (text-based) How each module will interact Sequence of development (step-by-step) What inputs the GUI will take What outputs will be displayed How to animate packets smoothly How to integrate NetworkX with Tkinter canvas After showing the plan, WAIT for me to ask for the next part. 📌 AFTER THE PLAN — NEXT PROMPTS I WILL REQUEST Please keep this in memory: after the plan we will build the project in stages. Stage 1: Build the GUI + topology editor Node class Link class Canvas drawing Click to add nodes Click to connect nodes Stage 2: Implement routing & Dijkstra integration Build graph Compute shortest path Highlight path Stage 3: Packet flow animation Implement packet object Hop-by-hop animation Stage 4: Latency + throughput engine Stage 5: Congestion control simulation Stage 6: Integration + testing Make sure your design supports all these stages.
